1. Identifique todas as tags na Listagem 1.2.  
Observe que você não precisa saber o que uma tag faz para ser capaz 
   de identificá-lo corretamente. Este é um bom exemplo de sofisticação
   técnica Quadro.  
2. Algumas tags HTML não contêm nenhum conteúdo e, em vez disso, são conhecidas como elementos void, também chamados de tags de fechamento automático.
   Qual tag na Listagem 1.2 é um elemento void?
3. . Quais tags HTML podem ser aninhadas, o que significa que uma tag pode ser colocada dentro de outra. Quais tags em Listagem 1.2 estão aninhados? Não inclua nenhuma tag de fechamento automático.

<p>  
  HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.
  It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his
  cat, but it would be cool if it were.

## TypeScript  
Introduction to TypeScript
What is TypeScript

TypeScript is an open-source language maintained and developed by Microsoft.

Basically, TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor or in your CI/CD pipeline, and write more maintainable code.

We can talk about other TypeScript benefits later, let's see some examples now!
First TypeScript code

Take a look at this code snippet and then we can unpack it together:
## install  
```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

function isAdult(user: User): boolean {
  return user.age >= 18;
}

const justine = {
  name: 'Justine',
  age: 23,
} satisfies User;

const isJustineAnAdult = isAdult(justine);
```  

The first part (with the type keyword) is responsible for declaring our custom object type representing users. Later we utilize this newly created type to create function isAdult that accepts one argument of type User and returns boolean. After this, we create justine, our example data that can be used for calling the previously defined function. Finally, we create a new variable with information on whether justine is an adult.

There are additional things about this example that you should know. Firstly, if we do not comply with the declared types, TypeScript will inform us that something is wrong and prevent misuse. Secondly, not everything must be typed explicitly—TypeScript infers types for us. For example, the variable isJustineAnAdult is of type boolean even if we didn't type it explicitly, and justine would be a valid argument for our function even though we didn't declare this variable as of User type.
How to run TypeScript code

Okay, so we have some TypeScript code. Now how do we run it? There are few possible ways to run TypeScript code, we will cover all of them in the next articles.

## Running TypeScript code using transpilation

Transpilation is the process of converting source code from one language to another. In the case of TypeScript, it's the process of converting TypeScript code to JavaScript code. This is necessary because browsers and Node.js can't run TypeScript code directly.
Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript

The most common way to run TypeScript code is to compile it to JavaScript first. You can do this using the TypeScript compiler tsc.
```ts
Step 1: Write your TypeScript code in a file, for example example.ts.  
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

function isAdult(user: User): boolean {
  return user.age >= 18;
}

const justine = {
  name: 'Justine',
  age: 23,
} satisfies User;

const isJustineAnAdult = isAdult(justine);
```  
# nodejs

## npm
npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

npm consists of three distinct components:

    the website
    the Command Line Interface (CLI)
    the registry

Use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up organizations to manage access to public or private packages.

The CLI runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with npm.

The registry is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it.
Use npm to . . .

    Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
    Download standalone tools you can use right away.
    Run packages without downloading using npx.
    Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
    Restrict code to specific developers.
    Create organizations to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
    Form virtual teams by using organizations.
    Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
    Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
    Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
    Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.

Getting started

To get started with npm, you can create an account, which will be available at http://www.npmjs.com/~yourusername.

After you set up an npm account, the next step is to use the command line interface (CLI) to install npm. We look forward to seeing what you create!
Sharing packages and collaborating with others

If you choose to share your packages publicly, there is no cost. To use and share private packages, you need to upgrade your account. To share with others, create organizations, called npm organizations, and invite others to work with you, privately (for a fee) or publicly (for free).

You can also use a private npm package registry like GitHub Packages or the open source Verdaccio project. This lets you develop packages internally that are not shared publicly.
Learn more

To learn more about npm as a product, upcoming new features, and interesting uses of npm be sure to follow @npmjs on Twitter.

For mentoring, tutorials, and learning, visit node school. Consider attending or hosting a nodeschool event (usually free!) at a site near you, or use the self-help tools you can find on the site.
CLI reference documentation
While relevant CLI commands are covered throughout this user documentation, the CLI includes command line help, its own documentation section, and instant help (man pages).
